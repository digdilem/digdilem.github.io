"How to water cool computers using household plumbing equipment"

I like peace and quiet. Most water cooling rigs available for home PCs are anything but - they only use water to move the heat away from the CPU and GPU to a finned radiator, then blast it with fans. I thought that radiant cooling would work and not need any fans, so I built a water cooling system. It worked perfectly for a linux server and my gaming windows PC for three years, until I had to free up space and instead focussed on sound proofing a cupboard and using air cooling. This was back in around 2015 but no reason why it wouldn't work today.
