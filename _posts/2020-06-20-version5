I'm letting the hosting for my vps lapse soon, as I no longer require it. For the few things I want to share with the world, Github's free posting seems to offer everything I need.

5 "ish" because I've lost track of how many times I've written a website for personal reasons. HTML, cgi, wordpress and now Jekyll.
